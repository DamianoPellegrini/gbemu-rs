# gmemu-rs, a headless gameboy emulator *(WIP)*

This is my attempt at writing a Gameboy emulator in Rust, started as a fun project to work on before my exams. The goal is to have a headless emulator that can be used as a library in other projects.

Many things such as graphics and input emulation are not implemented yet, it should run some games but it is still in its early stages. When graphics emulation will be implemented, I will probably add a simple GUI to the emulator as and example using bevy.
